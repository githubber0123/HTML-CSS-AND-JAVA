                          <p>I am currently a Professional Writing and Experience Architecture double major at Michigan State University. Through these programs, I am honing my editing and writing skills and learning design methods so as to communicate effectively, while always keeping the audience in mind. Both majors also emphasize technological skills, and have introduced me to HTML and CSS coding, as well as programs in the Adobe Creative Cloud. </p>
                          <p>Throughout my professional and educational experiences, I have learned a multitude of communication techniques. I believe that communication is the most vital part of any profession and can come in a wide variety of forms and alongside many other skills. Within this portfolio are samples of my work focusing on my skills in design, communication, research, and editing, all of which are necessary to create one document that effectively communicates a message to an audience.</p>
                          <p>Currently, I picture myself working as a communications manager for a local company or maybe a branch of a larger company, where I could work with the website, digital and print communications, social media, and more. This would let me dabble in things I find interesting, like using social media for business, while also applying my enthusiasm for website and document design. However, as I am still in the midst of my education, I am keeping my mind wide open for other new and exciting opportunities.</p> 
                      
                      <h3>What's on my desk?</h3>
                          <p>These are resources that I have learned a lot from, refer to on a regular basis, or just keep near me so that I have them when I want them. Each is important in its own right, and all of them are a piece of what makes me a professional.</p>
                          <p>While I am very organized and always have a schedule in mind, it’s best to have a back-up to check just in case. <b>My planner</b> travels with me everywhere I go, with every assignment, deadline, and meeting logged in.</p>
                          <p>I believe branding is important for every business, so having <b>the in-house style guide</b> near at hand is a necessity, whether it be <i>The Chicago Manual of Style</i> or just a set of preferred titles.</p>
                          <p>While the <a class="desk" target="_blank" href="http://www.abookapart.com/collections/complete-library"><b>A Book Apart series</b></a> is too large to keep on my desk, it will definitely be located on a shelf very close by. Each book explores a different aspect of web design, from HTML5 and CSS3 to research, content strategy, and design. Every book is a gem and keeping them on hand will remind me of the many interesting aspects of my desired profession.</p>
                          <p><a class="desk" target="_blank" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/"><b>Merriam-Webster Dictionary</b></a> has been published in print for around 150 years and is now also available online. It provides up-to-date definitions, histories, and usages of words. While I have used other dictionaries, I find that Merriam-Webster is one of the more appropriate for use in a professional environment while still being easily accessible.</p>
                          <p>Karl Stolley's <a class="desk" target="_blank" href="http://sustainablewebdesign.com/book/#book"><b>How to Design and Write Web Pages Today</b></a> contains information about creating websites and writing for the web. Stolley offers insights on coding and technological challenges, as well as tips to using open-sourced software like WordPress. He also provides a <a target="_blank" href="http://sustainablewebdesign.com/book/">companion website</a> with examples, resources, and updates that I can refer to when the hard copy book doesn’t quite cover what I’m looking for.</p>
                          <p><a class="desk" target="_blank" href="http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/booksellers/press_release/100misuses/"><b>100 Words Almost Everyone Confuses and Misuses</b></a> is an English usage guide that contains pronunciations, definitions, etymologies, and examples of usage for exactly 100 words. Many of these also have usage notes derived from The American Heritage Book of English Usage that explain common uses and mistakes. 100 Words Almost Everyone Confuses and Misuses may not be meant for use by language professionals, but with notes about common language and a perspective between descriptivist and prescriptivist, this short guide is an invaluable tool for helping me as a professional think about my audience’s use of language.</p>
